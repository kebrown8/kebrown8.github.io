  <h2 class="About">About Me</h2>
<!--biography-->
<p>My name is Kevin Brown and I am a senior journalism major at the Phillip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. As a high school senior, I knew I was good at two things: writing and liking sports. Before learning how much journalistic refinement was needed to improve my writing skills, I joined my high school newspaper and quickly became the sports editor. The decline of the newspaper industry, however, caught my eye as I entered my freshman year at the University of Maryland and decided to join the new on campus sports blog, The Left Bench, instead. It was here where senior editors helped me hone my craft and mold my reporting abilities to what they are today. A few beats and a couple hundred articles later, my current roommates and I decided to start our own sports blog called What the Sports. Our aim was to create a sports website that focused on unique and humorous content, providing a different kind of outlet from the other campus publications.
</p>
<p>This at-first side project quickly became a full operation with a staff of nearly 20 undergraduates interested in expressing their sports takes throughout the web. We held meetings to gauge general interests, plan content management and execute social media promotion. The results were both rewarding yet challenging. The three founders would often have conference calls and brainstorm sessions discussing the best ways to take our site in the best direction. I worked diligently building up a social media brand that rapidly garnered over a thousand followers and several viral tweets to not only raise blog viewership, but also raise awareness of the What the Sports name. The more I promoted articles through Facebook groups or Reddit pages, the better I was at navigating through a consumer’s perspective. Our articles and tweets were featured on pages like Bleacher Report and USA Today Sports.</p>
<p>While the three of us went our separate ways to more professional journalistic opportunities elsewhere, we still keep the What the Sports brand alive through our weekly podcast. I’m in the process of creating an animated show for our YouTube channel, which currently has plenty of videos I’ve edited to showcase my versatility as a multimedia reporter – something that has become so important in today’s industry. I truly believe I can execute all areas of journalism at a high level. This can be seen through my written content with NBC Sports Washington and Inside Lacrosse, video reporting with The Left Bench TV, social media promotion and video editing with Monumental Sports Network and content strategy and execution with What the Sports. No matter the assignment, I often take it on with a upper level management type of attitude.</p>
