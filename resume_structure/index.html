  <h2 class="About">About Me</h2>
<!--biography-->
<p>My name is Kevin Brown and I am a senior journalism major at the Phillip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. As a high school senior, I knew I was good at two things: writing and liking sports. Before learning how much journalistic refinement was needed to improve my writing skills, I joined my high school newspaper and quickly became the sports editor. The decline of the newspaper industry, however, caught my eye as I entered my freshman year at the University of Maryland and decided to join the new on-campus sports blog, The Left Bench, instead. It was here where senior editors helped me hone my craft and mold my reporting abilities to what they are today. A few beats and a couple hundred articles later, my current roommates and I decided to start our own sports blog called What the Sports. Our aim was to create a sports website that focused on unique and humorous content, providing a different kind of outlet from the other campus publications.
</p>
<p>This at-first side project quickly became a full operation with a staff of nearly 20 undergraduates interested in expressing their sports takes throughout the web. We held meetings to gauge general interests, plan content management and execute social media promotion. The results were both rewarding yet challenging. The three founders would often have conference calls and brainstorm sessions discussing the best ways to take our site in the best direction. I worked diligently building up a social media brand that rapidly garnered over a thousand followers and several viral tweets to not only raise blog viewership, but also raise awareness of the What the Sports name. The more I promoted articles through Facebook groups or Reddit pages, the better I was at navigating through a consumer’s perspective. Our articles and tweets were featured on pages like Bleacher Report and USA Today Sports.</p>
<p>While the three of us went our separate ways to more professional journalistic opportunities elsewhere, we still keep the What the Sports brand alive through our weekly podcast. I’m in the process of creating an animated show for our YouTube channel, which currently has plenty of videos I’ve edited to showcase my versatility as a multimedia reporter – something that has become so important in today’s industry. I truly believe I can execute all areas of journalism at a high level. This can be seen through my written content with NBC Sports Washington and Inside Lacrosse, video reporting with The Left Bench TV, social media promotion and video editing with Monumental Sports Network and content strategy and execution with What the Sports. No matter the assignment, I often take it on with a upper level management type of attitude. If given the opportunity to work for your outlet, I will bring the versatility and innovation a modern journalist needs to the newsroom. </p>

  <h3>Articles</h3>
    <h4>Freelance Samples</h4>
      <h5>Recruiting landscape on full display at 2018 Slam Dunk to the Beach</h5>
        <p>I took the initiative to cover a top-notch high school recruiting basketball tournament for my hometown paper, the Cape Gazette. Interviewing high caliber recruits like Jonathan Kuminga and Khalil Whitney, I was able to put together an article that captured the recruiting ins and outs for players of all talent levels. <a href="https://www.capegazette.com/article/recruiting-landscape-full-display-2018-slam-dunk/172281">READ</a></p>
      <h5>Yale's Back-to-Back Bid Comes Up Short in Title Game</h5>
        <p>After freelancing for Inside Lacrosse last fall, I was asked to help cover the 2019 NCAA Final Four in Philadelphia. This is lacrosse's biggest stage, especially due to a lack of a concrete professional game, and to help cover it for such a widely circulated magazine was truly an honor. I was tasked with writing the sidebar pieces to be immediately published following the games. For the championship game, I wrote about the runner-ups, Yale, who fell to the University of Virginia. <a href="https://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/yale-s-back-to-back-bid-comes-up-short-in-title-game/54683">READ</a></p>
    <h4>Beat Reporting Samples</h4>
      <h5>Maryland’s losing streak extends to five with 2-1 loss to Wisconsin</h5>
        <p>For my second beat covered at Maryland, I followed the school's men's soccer team on a weekly basis with a combination of instant game reports, previews and analytical articles. The 2017 season ended sourly for the Terps, failing to score or even muster up attacks on a regular basis. This gamer shows my ability to write under deadline and use context to give readers a good idea of what's going on with the team, showing my ability to pick up on patterns. <a href="https://theleftbench.com/blog/2017/11/05/maryland-wisconsin/">READ</a>
      <h5>Terps advance to fifth straight NCAA Final Four with 13-8 win over Cornell</h5>
        <p>Similar to my men's soccer beat coverage, I provided in-depth analysis with my gamers and previews while covering the men's lacrosse team. Here you can see another example of my ability to write under deadline, this time on location from the 2018 NCAA Quarterfinals at Navy Stadium in Annapolis, MD, where the Terps defeated Cornell. <a href="https://theleftbench.com/blog/2018/05/20/terps-advance-fifth-straight-ncaa-final-four-13-8-win-cornell/">READ</a>
    <h4>Feature Story Sample</h4>
      <h5>Package deal: Di Rosa twins use brotherly bond to elevate game</h5>
        <p>My favorite artilce I've written while in college, this shows my ability to write a feature artilce showcasing the story behind the players. As an identical twin myself, it was awesome to tell the story of the Di Rosa brothers from the men's soccer team. <a href="https://theleftbench.com/blog/2018/11/07/package-deal-di-rosa-twins-use-brotherly-bond-to-elevate-game/">READ</a>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
    <h4>Video Editing</h4>
      <h5>Washington Mystics promotional video</h5>
        <p>Using Adobe Premiere, I created promotional videos for the Washington Mystics during my Summer internship with Monumental Sports Network as a video producer and social media contributor. One of the videos was even used to promote the deciding championship game when the Mystics captured their first-ever WNBA title. <a href="https://twitter.com/MonSportsNet/status/1182306037807763456">WATCH</a></p>
    <h4>Podcasts</h4>
      <h5>What the Sports' Impractial Sports Podcast</h5>
        <p>Recorded, produced, edited and coordinated podcasts through the sports blog I co-founded along with two other seniors, Noah Gross and Ryan Homler. Touching on the most relevant sports news of each week, the podcasts include elements of humor, uniqueness and interesting sports takes. <a href="https://t.co/2SKsDvgOjE?amp=1">LISTEN</a></p>
